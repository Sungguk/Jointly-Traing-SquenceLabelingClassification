# Jointly-Training-of-Sequence-Labeling-and-Classification
1. Implementation of "Jointly Trained Sequential Labeling and Classification by Sparse Attention Neural Networks" by Mingbo Ma et. al. (2017)
  - Joint-Traning of Sequence-Labeling and Classification
  - Strongly correlation between topics of Text and meaning of words 
  - Representative example
    - sentence: "Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_buffalo_Buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_Buffalo_buffalo )
  - Sparse Attention cf. Attention in QA and Machine Translation
2. Dataset of ATIS used
3. Tensorflow
